# RADAR5Builder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/devmotion/RADAR5Builder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/devmotion/RADAR5Builder)

This repository builds binary libraries for the delay differential equation solver [RADAR5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s006070170013) by Nicola Guglielmi and Ernst Hairer. The libraries are automatically uploaded to [this repository's GitHub releases page](https://github.com/devmotion/RADAR5Builder/releases) whenever a tag is created on this repository.

This repository was created using [BinaryBuilder.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder.jl).
